This repository contains small demonstration of Session Tracking using Cookies in Servlets

## Introduction

Session tracking is a vital aspect of web development that allows web applications to maintain state and user-specific data across multiple requests. One of the most common methods for achieving session tracking in web applications is by using cookies. This README provides a comprehensive guide on implementing session tracking in web applications using cookies.

## How Cookies Enable Session Tracking

Cookies are small pieces of data that a web server sends to a user's browser to be stored locally. They enable session tracking by storing a unique session identifier on the user's browser. This session identifier is sent with each HTTP request, allowing the server to associate subsequent requests with a specific session.
